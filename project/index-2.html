    <p>
      The snow on a Vanillite's head can melt with heat or repeated touching, leaving it with a "bald" appearance of simply an ice creature.Vanillite are born from icicles that are hit by morning sunlight and wish not to melt. It can blow winds as low as -58 °F (-50 °C), which causes it to create ice crystals and make it snow in nearby areas when it exhales. It sleeps buried under snow and gains energy from the morning sun. In hotter regions, it is treasured by households, though it shrinks little by little.
